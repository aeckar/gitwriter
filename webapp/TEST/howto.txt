TO INSTALL SHADCN (https://www.shadcn-vue.com/docs/installation/vite.html)


npx shadcn-vue@latest init

npx shadcn-vue@latest add <component>

npm install lucide-vue-next

Why does this work for href but NOT for style?
Vue template compiler processes some attributes like href, title, and alt to support interpolation inside them as a convenience.

But for complex attributes like style, class, or any dynamic binding, you need to use : binding syntax (v-bind:style) to properly handle objects, reactivity, and security.
